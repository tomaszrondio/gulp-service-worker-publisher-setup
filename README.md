# Publisher theme starter (gulp + service worker precache)
1. install node.js
2. install npm
3. install gulp globally if U haven't already - 'npm install --global gulp-cli'
4. run 'npm install' in project folder



there are two main tasks:
- gulp watch (watches for changes in sass/js files and bundles them to dist folder)
- gulp build (bundles assets and generates service worker file)
